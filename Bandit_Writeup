OverTheWire - Bandit
Hello! you'll find my solutions to the Bandit challenges with an explanation, hopefully, this helps you if you're struggling.

This is a guide that helps you through the challenges, so you can follow up and actually do the challenges, so no passwords will be provided._
Level 0
Explanation:
The goal of this challenge is to connect to the provided server via ssh.

To be able to use ssh you will always need 3 things:
1. The server's ip
2. The username
3. The password

so the command will be structured this way:

ssh username@ip

ssh uses 22 as a default port, but sometimes the administrator may change it, if that's the case, you'll have to provide it.

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
use bandit0 as a password as well

Level 0 → 1
Explanation:
Now that you are inside the challenge server we can start solving these challenges.

Solving a challenge will give you the password of the next user, this way you can keep levelling up.

For this challenge, the password is stored in a file "-" in the home directory of bandit0 user.
Solution-

bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat '-'

Password:ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

Level 1 → 2
Explanation:

The "cat" command is not always used to echo out files content, it has different usages, so for instance if no filename is provided or the filename is "-" it will read from the stdin instead.

Solution

bandit1@bandit:~$ ls

bandit1@bandit:~$ ./- 
Password: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx


Level 2 → 3
Explanation:

To solve this challenge we need to _escape_ the character space.
Solution-

bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
Password: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

Level 3 → 4
Explanation:
In this challenge we need to change directory and list _all_ the files.

In Linux and Unix systems, the files starting with . (a dot) are hidden files.
Solution-

bandit3@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May  7  2020 inhere
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 May  7  2020 .hidden
bandit3@bandit:~$ cat .hidden
Password: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

Level 4 → 5
Explanation:
Same as the previous challenge we need to change the directory, but once we do it, we are granted 9 files, one of which contains the password.

The hint states that the file we are looking for is human-readable (text), so we need to perform a simple check against all the files using the "file" command.
Solution-

bandit4@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May  7  2020 inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./* | grep "text" # there is no need for the grep in this level.
./-file07: ASCII text
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07
Password: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

Level 5 → 6
Explanation:
In this challenge, we are granted 20 directories, each directory has multiple files, making it impossible to inspect the content of every file one by one, and only one out of these files has the password.

The file we are looking for has some unique properties:
1. human-readable
2. 1033 bytes in size
3. not executable

We can use the "find" command and get it easily.

bandit5@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-x--- 22 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls 
maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2
Password: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

Level 6 → 7
Explanation:
Similar to the previous challenge, we need to look for a file, but this time, across the system, the file has these unique properties:
1. owned by user bandit7
2. owned by group bandit6
3. 33 bytes in size

The "find" command for the rescue!
Solution:

bandit6@bandit:~$ ls
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Password: morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

Level 7 → 8
Explanation:
This challenge requires us to filter a big text file by grabbing a specific word.

The "grep" command is suitable for the job.

Solution-

bandit7@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep "millionth"
millionth       [REDACTED]
bandit7@bandit:~$
Password:dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc


Level 8 → 9
Explanation:
Similar to the previous challenge, we need to filter a big text file, the line we are looking for is the only line that occurs once, so we need to remove all the duplicates and echo out the content.
Solution-

bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
Password:4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM

Level 9 → 10
Explanation:
Still the same style as the previous one, to get the password we need to do some kind of filtering.

In this challenge, the password we are looking for is in one of the few _human-readable_ strings, preceded by several = characters.

We will create our first very simple _regular expression_ (a pattern) to get all words preceded by at least one =.

Regular Expressions are so interesting and a great skill to have, here are some resources:

Solution

bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "=.*"
Password: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

Level 10 → 11
Explanation:
This time, there is no filtering, the challenge is straight forward, all we need to do is decoding the _base64_ text.

If you've never heard about this encoding, or what bases are, I highly recommend reading these articles:

Solution-

bandit10@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | base64 -d
Password: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr

Level 11 → 12
Explanation:
In this challenge the file content have been rotated by 13 positions, it's a common encryption called _rot13_ which replaces a letter with the 13th etter after it in the alphabet.

We can simply use the "tr" command and replace one set of alphabet with another set.

I highly recommend reading more about the tr command:

Solution-

bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
Password:  7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

Level 12 → 13
Explanation:
This task is simple, but so repetitive, we have a Hex Dump that should be reverse engineered to a binary, and we start the decompression journey.

Note that in the solution I went quick, to know what decompression you are going for, use the "file" command as we learned in the previous challenges.
Solution-

bandit12@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/oussama
bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/oussama
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ cp ~/data.txt .
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ xxd -r data > binary
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ mv binary binary.gz # we need that suffix for the command to work
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ gzip -d binary.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ bzip2 -d binary
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ mv binary.out binary.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ gzip -d binary.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ tar -xf binary
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ tar -xf data5.bin
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ bzip2 -d data6.bin 2>/dev/null
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ tar -xf data6.bin.out
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ mv data8.bin data8.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ gzip -d data8.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ cat data8

Level 13 → 14
Explanation:
Well this has to be one of the easiest tasks, as we are given the ssh private key.

All these challenges we've been using the _password_ to login, but this is only an option, as we can use the private key instead, and that's exactly what we've done here.

Solution-

bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost

Level 14 → 15
Explanation:
To get the next password, we need to submit the current password to a service running on port 30000.

This can be done by using "netcat" command.

Solution

bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

bandit14@bandit:~$ nc 127.0.0.1 30000

Level 15 → 16
Explanation:
It is almost the same challenge, the only difference is that server running this service is using SSL.

Solution-

bandit15@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15

bandit15@bandit:~$ ncat -C --ssl 127.0.0.1 30001

Level 16 → 17
Explanation:
This challenge will test what we learned in the previous ones, we need to locate all the services running in a specific range, then connect to each one of them, submit the current password, and get a private key that will eventually help us get the wanted password.
Solution-

bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p 31000-32000 127.0.0.1
Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-07-04 11:39 CEST

Correct!
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
bandit16@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/oussama
bandit16@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/oussama
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ nano id_rsa # paste the content and hit ctrl+o then ctrl+x
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ chmod 600 id_rsa
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/oussama$ ssh -i id_rsa bandit17@localhost
bandit17@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17

Level 17 → 18
Explanation:
This challenge is straightforward, we have two files (passwords.old, passwords.new), the password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between the two files.
Solution-

bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new
42c42
w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii

Level 18 → 19
Explanation:
In this challenge we are logged out as soon as we log in, the password is saved in a file called "readme" in the home directory, so we can simply echo out the content without connecting.

Solution-

oussama@oussama:~$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 'cat ~/readme'
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.orgs password:

Level 19 → 20
Explanation:
In this challenge, we will learn about the "setuid" (set user ID) which is a special type of file permission when set a user may execute the binary with a level of access that matches the user who owns the file.

Solution-

bandit19@bandit:~$ ls
bandit20-do
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

Level 20 → 21
Explanation:
In this challenge we are given a binary that has a setuid (like the previous challenge), this binary needs a port as an argument, it will connect to the service running on that port, reads the current password, if it matches, it will provide the next password.

So we need to create a service that when connected to, provides the current password, and run it in the background so continue using our session.
Solution-

bandit20@bandit:~$ ls
suconnect
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect
Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP. If it receives the correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back.
bandit20@bandit:~$ echo "[REDACTED - Current Password]" | netcat -lp 4444 &
[1] 15831
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 4444
Read: 
Password matches, sending next password
